# Search and Information Gathering Tool

## ⚠️ **Important Warning** ⚠️

**This tool should be used with _care_ and _prudence_**. Performing mass searches or scraping without moderation can lead to **IP blocking** from the services you use, such as Google, social networks or the Deep Web.

### 🛑 **Tips to avoid blocks**:
- **Perform moderate searches**: Avoid doing too many searches in a short period of time.
- **Use a VPN or Tor**: If you are going to do multiple searches, using a VPN or Tor can help protect your IP.
- **Don't overdo searches**: If you want to do mass searches, try to space out the queries and allow enough time between each one.

**Use this tool responsibly!** ⚠️

## 🔐 **Safe use on the Deep Web**:
If you are going to use the tool to search the Deep Web, keep in mind that many sites may be monitored. To make queries more safely, consider using:

- **VPN**: Protect your connection and hide your IP.
- **Tor**: Access the Deep Web anonymously.
